# This is my repository for evolutionary computational solutions for optimizing various problems

- This readme will serve as an updates to the status of each project.

## boostrap.py

    - This file is the basis for the following programs in the file. it has very basic outlining and doucmentation for
    a genral EC solutions. 

## nqueens.py - needs optimization

    - Solves the n queens problem of nxn size with input of starting population size. 
    - Very basic ec solution rn that has trouble converging for larger search spaces and this needs to be optimized
    - and encoder function that translates the 2d arrays into a more apporpriate gui for the user would also be nice for display 

## napsack.py - needs to be started

    - EC solution to the napsack problem 
    - needs to be started and thought out
