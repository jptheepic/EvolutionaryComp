# This file I will implement an EC solution to optimize the Knapsack problem.
# This problem is defined as: Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value,
# Determine the number ofeach item toinclude in a collection so that thetotal
# weight is less then or equal to a given limit andthe total valueis as large as possible.

# We will use an binary array of N size where N is the number of items that could be
# Included in the sack.
