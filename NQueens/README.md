# N-Queens Evolutionary Aglorithm

- In this directory I have solved N-Queens with an evlountionary alrogithm approach for optimizaion of the problem.
- I also used pygame to show when the best fitness is updated and will display the errors on the board. This helps lead to an easy explination of the program.
- This was created using python 3.9.12

In order to run the program you will have to run the following commands inside of this directory
```
pip install -f requirments.txt
```

Then you can run 
```
python nqueens.py
```
